                <p className='font-poppins text-[#616f6f]'>
                    Vaccination is the process of administering an antigenic substance or vaccine that provides immunity against one or more diseases. It stimulates immunity in the human body and protects the vaccinated person from infection and thus prevents the onset of the disease. <br /> <br />

                    The term vaccination and immunization have often been mistakenly used interchangeably as both have different meanings. While vaccination is the administration of a vaccine, immunization is basically what happens to the body after being vaccinated. <br /> <br />

                    Portea brings forth different types of vaccinations at the comfort of your home. H1N1, Chicken Pox, Typhoid, Hepatitis B, Pneumonia, Cervical cancer are some of the regularly administered vaccinations for India. You can also get other types of new vaccines on special request.

Thanks to vaccination a number of diseases like polio and small pox have been successfully eradicated. In fact, the Government of India has made a list of vaccines to be compulsory administered to kids that provide protection from diseases like – Tuberculosis, Diphtheria, Pertusis, Polio, Measles, Mumps, Hepatitis A and B, Typhoid, Rubella and Rotavirus. <br /> <br />
