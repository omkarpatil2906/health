                <p className='font-poppins text-[#616f6f]'>
                    Every once in a while, you’re bound to need to consult with a doctor for general health check-up, seasonal fever, acute diseases, chronic illness, and more. It many situations, we are physically weak and prefer to stay at home and even a visit to a doctor seems an uphill task. If given an option we would rather prefer a doctor to give us a visit, rather than we having to visit him personally. <br /> <br />

                    To fill this void, Portea™ has begun to provide doctor consultation at home and that too at reasonable costs compared to traditional hospitals and nursing homes. The home visit doctors are qualified professionals and provide consultation to treatment and help you throughout your recovery process. The best part about in-home doctor service is you will be treated in the comfort of your home, surrounded by your family members.

                    Kanchan Arora Found Help In Portea?</h1>

                <p className='font-poppins text-[#616f6f]'>
                    We engaged Portea in 2017 so that our mother, Kanchan Arora, could have medical care from a doctor who would visit her at home and take charge of supervising her overall health.
                    We were very lucky in being assigned Dr Shabnam Mir. Not only is Dr Shabnam skilled and competent, she has the sort of calm manner that I wish all doctors everywhere in the world had. She is consistently patient, kind, compassionate and humane. Besides, she is accessible at all times and never makes us feel we are imposing on her when we whatsapp message or call her with a question. She is always quick to respond. <br /> <br />
                    Our mother looks forward to her monthly visits and that says a lot for the kind of doctor that Dr Shabnam is. It is almost as though a friend were dropping in. Psychologically, she does wonders for our mother and many is the time Dr Shabnam has talked her/us through a problem and calmed her down. Our mother recently said that she was lucky to have Dr Shabnam in her life, since she could call her any time she had a medical concern. <br /> <br />
                    Dr Shabnam’s cheerful and lively personality enhances her professional expertise.
                    On behalf of my siblings and mother, I thank Dr Shabnam and Portea for the quality of care and the psychological boost that Dr Shabnam provides for our mother.
