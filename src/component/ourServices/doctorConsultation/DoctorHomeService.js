                <p className='font-poppins'>
                Every once in a while, you’re bound to need to consult with a doctor for general health check-up, seasonal fever, acute diseases, chronic illness, and more. It many situations, we are physically weak and prefer to stay at home and even a visit to a doctor seems an uphill task. If given an option we would rather prefer a doctor to give us a visit, rather than we having to visit him personally. <br /> <br />

                To fill this void, Portea™ has begun to provide doctor consultation at home and that too at reasonable costs compared to traditional hospitals and nursing homes. The home visit doctors are qualified professionals and provide consultation to treatment and help you throughout your recovery process. The best part about in-home doctor service is you will be treated in the comfort of your home, surrounded by your family members.
