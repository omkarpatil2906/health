                    Generally speaking, counseling falls in the ambit of “Talking therapy” that allows and encourages people to speak out about their feelings and concerns in a private and confidential environment. <br /> <br />

                    The counselor provides the person with the much needed space where the person can be themselves and speak out without having to sound correct, just open up about how they actually feel, without the fear of being judged or criticized and also without any unsolicited advice.  <br /> <br />

                    This luxury of being able to speak out without any restrictions or having to conform to any norms has been found to be quite beneficial to a lot many individuals.  <br /> <br />

                    After thoroughly understanding the person’s situation, the counselor advises him in a way that improves his situation.  <br /> <br />

                    With the advent of technology you can easily avail of in home counseling services that too staying anonymously if you don’t wish to reveal yourself.  <br /> <br />

                    At Portea our well trained and empathetic counselors provide anonymous support therapy through Audio and Video calls and at home counseling sessions also.  <br /> <br />

                <p className='font-poppins text-[#616f6f]'>
                    Counseling today plays a very significant role in the well being of an individual. We often hear of people ending their life, just because they couldn’t deal with their stress and frustration.  <br /> <br />

                    It is important to know that we can approach someone and completely open up to them with complete confidentiality.  <br /> <br />

                    Quite often people brush away the suggestion of seeing a counselor, as they believe that counseling is only for crisis situation, but they don’t realize that counseling can help with something as simple as reaching a goal.  <br /> <br />

                    A counselor offers a helping hand to people who come to them irrespective of their needs and drag them out of their mental rut.  <br /> <br />

                    Moreover it is better to seek help rather than keep quiet and suffer.  <br /> <br />

                    You can always choose to stop the counseling after you feel you are fine and have made recovery.  <br /> <br />

                    There is no compulsion to continue with the session if you find yourself mentally fit to lead a happy and stress free life.
